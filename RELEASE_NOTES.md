# ETR3 2025: Elytra Threat, Risk and Resilience Report

## Overview
ETR3 2025 provides a clear, decision-focused view of the global cybersecurity threat landscape and resilience priorities. It is written for boards, CXOs, CISOs, and operational leaders who need facts, clarity, and action—without noise. Our long-term goal is to build ETR3 into a global benchmark on par with flagship reports such as DBIR.

## Highlights
- Material threat vectors and attack pathways shaping 2025
- Global exposure themes with regional lenses where relevant
- Control priorities mapped to leading standards and regulatory expectations
- Practical resilience checklists for leadership, SOC, and IT operations
- Concise figures and tables for briefings, playbooks, and audits
